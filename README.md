# Skin-Diseases-Classification
This implementation compares different deep learning and machine learning models for classifying skin diseases. It looks at how well each model performs and discusses their strengths and weaknesses to help the automated skin disease diagnosis in the future. 

## Dataset Description
This study uses a dataset of 9,548 dermatoscopic images showing different skin conditions. The images are divided into five categories: acne (1,148 images), vitiligo (2,016), hyperpigmentation (700), nail psoriasis (2,520), and SJS-TEN (3,164). These images were collected from hospitals and online sources in different countries. The dataset was published on Mendeley Data on July 30, 2024, by Sharun Akter Khushbu.

The images in this dataset have not been pre-processed, which makes it more challenging to train machine learning models. Since the dataset focuses on rare skin diseases, it is especially useful for testing how well transfer learning techniques can classify skin conditions using medical images. The link for dataset -
